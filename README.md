## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

- [FCC React Beginner Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8&t=36252s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) - I essentially used everything I learned in this video to build this app, so I recommend checking it out if you're looking to take your first dive into React!
- [Create a Persisting Dark Mode with React](https://www.pullrequest.com/blog/create-a-persisting-dark-mode-with-react/) - I used this blog post to help me implement the persisting light/dark mode functionality.
